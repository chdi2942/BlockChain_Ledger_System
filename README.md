# BlockChain_Ledger_System

################################################################################
In this program, we'll build a ledger to record transactions on the blockchain.  We will achieve this by

# Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
# * Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the
# blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger
# will store.

# Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
# * Change the existing `Block` data class by replacing the generic `data`
# attribute with a `record` attribute that’s of type `Record`.

# Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
# * Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These
# input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record
# that you’ll store in the `PyChain` ledger.

# Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
# * Test your complete `PyChain` ledger.
